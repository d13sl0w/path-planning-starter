# path-planning-starter
A starter for Udacity SDC path planning project.

# Why
Got a bit tired of Udacity projects starter code mess (usually, its a monster function with lots of variables, lots of duplication and lots of confusion). Decided that sharing a cleaner starter code will benefit all the SDC students.

# Princiles I tried to stick to

## Clean code, SOLID stuff
## Reasonable usage of modern C++
